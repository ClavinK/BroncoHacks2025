        <h2>What are Phone Scams?</h2>
        <p>
            A <strong>phone scam</strong> is when a scammer calls you and tries to trick you into giving them your
            personal
            information or money by pretending to be someone they are not. These can include banks, government workers,
            or even a family
            member.
        </p>
        <p>
            Here are some signs of a phone scam:
        <ul>
            <li>They say you owe them money or that you are in trouble</li>
            <li>They ask for your social security number, bank info, or other sensitive information</li>
            <li>They want to you to buy gift cards or send money fast</li>
            <li>They say, "Don't tell anyone"</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
