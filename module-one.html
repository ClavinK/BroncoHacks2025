    <h1>Module 1: What is the Internet?</h1>
    <div class="introduction">
        <h2>What is the Internet and the Web?</h2>
        <p>When you think of the Internet, think of it as a route to get from point A 
            to point B. The Internet, at its simplest form, is like a series of wires 
            and roads that connect computers and devices all over the world.
        </p>
        <p>
            When thinking of the World Wide Web, or Web for short, think of it as a 
            collection of houses and stores you can visit. The Web is a collection of 
            stores or houses that you can visit using a Web Browswer. Some popular Web
            Browsers include Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Safari, and Mozilla Firefox.

            A Web Browser is like a TV remote, it allows you to find and navigate websites, 
            similar to how a TV remote allows you to find and navigate through different 
            channels.
