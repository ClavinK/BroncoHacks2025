        <h2>What is Phishing?</h2>
        <p>
            Email Phishing is when a scammer send you a <strong>fake email</strong> in an attempt to trick you into
            sharing or giving away your personal information. This includes things like your passwords, credit card
            information, or social security number.

        </p>
        <p>
            Here are some signs of email phishing:
        <ul>
            <li>
                Unusual sender email address
            </li>
            <li>
                Urgent language or threats
            </li>
            <li>
                It asks for private information like your password or credit card
            </li>
            <li>
                It has weird spelling or weird wording
            </li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>While it may look real, like it's from your own bank or a company that you frequent, it's more than likely
            from a scammer. Below is a quick video further explaining what Email Phishing is.</p>
