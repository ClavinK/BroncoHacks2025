    <h1>Module 2: How to stay safe on the Internet!</h1>
    <div class="safety">
        <h2>Staying Safe on the Internet</h2>
        <p>What exactly is online safety? Online safety essentially means protecting 
            yourself and your information when using the Internet. Much like how you 
            would lock your doors and windows to keep yourself safe at home, you should 
            also take the necessary steps to protect yourself online.
        </p>
        <p>
            Here are some safety rules to keep in mind when surfing the web:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Don't share personal info like your address, phone number, or 
                    passwords with strangers on the internet.
                </li>
                <li>Use stronger passwords and don't reuse the same password everywhere.</li>
                <li>
                    <strong><em>Think before you click</em></strong> - if a message, ad, 
                    pop-up, link, or email looks suspicious, do not click on it.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong><em>Keep Devices Updated</em></strong> - Make sure your 
                    devices (whether it be a computer, tablet, or phone) are always up to
                    date with the latest software and security updates.
                </li>
                <li>
                    When in doubt, as a trusted person in your life for help. If you are ever 
                    unsure of a text, email, link, website, or etc. ask someone you trust and is 
                    close to you for help. This could be a family member, friend, or professional in 
                    the industry.
                </li>
            </ul>
